        <h2>MoneyTree</h2>
        <p>A problem that many face today is spending money and not knowing when to stop. As things get more expensive and the number of things we "need" to buy steadily increases, this problem gets more severe. MoneyTree is designed to help you manage your money and resist unnecessary spending.</p>

        <p>A project created for the class Fundamentals of Human-Centered Interaction, Fall 2018, along with <a href="mailto:bryant.t.nguyen@colorado.edu">Bryant Nguyen</a> and <a href="mailto:dang0781@colorado.edu">Danny Nguyen</a>.</p>

                <h3>Design Research</h3>
                <p>There were two main methods of data collection that we used: 1:1 Interviews and Questionnaires.</p>
                <h4>1:1 Interviews</h4>
                <p>We interviewed college students of different financial standpoints, backgrounds, and ethnicities to see how useful a money-management app would be for them and what features would be beneficial to include in our app. There were a total of 6 students interviewed who were studying different fields in STEM and had different sources of income.</p>

                <h4>Questionnaire</h4>
                <p>An online questionnaire was distributed to students in a few different classes. This questionnaire aimed to learn the usual spending habits of a wider range of people so we can better visualize the problem with spending. </p>

                <h3>Paper Prototypes</h3>
                <p>We realized there were three critical areas we needed to include in our app: a spending summary screen, financial input screen for users to add bank accounts or other sources of income, and a goal progress screen.</p>

                <p>Example tasks that we wanted to be able to test are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>For first time users, create an acount using your email and password.</li>
                    <li>As a user, input a personalized spending goal. </li>
                    <li>As a user, you added specific spending goals the other day. Navigate to the Goals page to see how you're doing.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Here are two different prototype versions that were created. </p>
            </div>

                <h3>Usability Testing and Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
                <p>We conducted three study sessions where we observed a participant using both versions of the prototype to find the strong and weak points of both prototypes. We recorded general observations while the participants navigated through our app and then asked them:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>What did you like about Prototype A?</li>
                    <li>What did you dislike about Prototype A?</li>
                    <li>What did you like about Prototype B?</li>
                    <li>What did you dislike about Prototype B?</li>
                    <li>What was confusing about these prototypes? </li>
                    <li>Do you have any suggestions for improving these prototypes?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Afterwards, the three team members performed heuristic evaluation using Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design and filled out usability aspect reports for each heuristic for each prototype.</p>

                <h3>Final Prototype</h3>
                <p>We combined the successful features of each prototype found through A/B testing earlier and resolved the problems found during heuristic testing.</p>

                <p>Finally, the final prototype screens were created using Adobe Illustrator and <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/I4RujsvCGapnjlLtZTcM1Oxj/Final-Prototype?node-id=0%3A1">imported into Figma.</a> </p>
